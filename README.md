This project consists of two parts, namely a Unity App and a ROS Node. The Unity App is supposed to be run on a Hololens, while the ROS Node runs on the Trimbot.

**Please refer to the [Unity-App-README](unity_app/README.md) and the [ROS-Node-README](ros_node/README.md) for a guide on installation and deployment.**
